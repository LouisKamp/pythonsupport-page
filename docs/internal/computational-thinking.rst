Computational Thinking
======================

Our goal should be to:

* To teach the core competences of computational thinking
* To have a clear goal of each lesson
* To have engaging and well structured material
* Promote the use of programming for more than school activities

Challenges to overcome:

* Unengaged students
* Vulnerary material
* Placement of workshops

Most students will down prioritize voluntary classes or workshops to focus
on mandatory activities. This means that our biggest problem will be to 
convince students that we can teach them something that they won't learn 
from anywhere else. We therefore also have a big task to find out how to
best promote and reach out to the students that struggle with programming.

1. Core competences
-------------------

We will be basing the core competences on the Python programming language
since DTU has decided to include this language in the Polytechnical foundation.
Lessons in computational might not strictly be based on Python, but the
understanding gained from any of the material should lead to a better 
knowhow about the usage the language. In the following bullets we list 
some of the most important concepts when programming.

1. **Knowledge of the state of a program**

In order to solve complex problems a programmer will always have the state
of the program in mind. This is a crucial skill for a new computational thinker
to practice since it leads them to better reason about the code, predict outcomes
and debug more efficiently.

*What are the the current declared variables?*

*Where in the program is the instruction pointer?*


2. **The flow of the program**

Most good programmers have a good idea of how their code will end up looking 
like before they even start to code. This intuition that takes time to develop
and is practiced by learning how to do software architecture.

*What is the overarching goal of the given code and how does it achieve that?*

*What methods we as programmers have in our toolbox to solve problems?*

3. **Tools to make life easier for a programmer**

Most programmers do not code everything from scratch, we rely on existing 
software to make coding more efficient and enjoyable. This is not limited 
to how we code but also how to gain the understanding needed to solve a
problem. Therefore knowing how to search or seek information will help on almost
every problem, especially when combined with generative AI.

*Examples: debugger, type annotation, git, linting, formatters, generative AI*

4. **Communication of what a program does**

Computational thinking is more than just solving a problem in an efficient
way, it is also being able to communicate what a program does and why it
what considerations lead to the implementation. This skill is crucial to learn
since it facilitates better documentation which in turn makes teamwork more
efficient.

*How do programmers document their code for better teamwork?*


3. Lesson goals
---------------

In order to facilitate the above competences the following workshops are proposed.
Each workshop is given a catchy title, but with its content not constrained to that
title (give them what they came for but lets add a little extra).

.. card::

    **Title**: Tour de Python

    **Subtitle**: *Catchup workshop for python programming*

    **Schedule**: Beginning of each 13-week periods

    **Goal**: Gives students the opportunity to catch up on how to use Python for the following semester

    **Content**: Basic syntax, use of common packages

    **Material**: Give students the knowhow of where to find and use python documentation


.. card::

    **Title**: Git Your Grades Up! Track, Collaborate, Succeed.

    **Subtitle**: *How to use git efficiently in your studies*

    **Goal**: Get students started with using git in their coding projects

    **Content**: Basic git and github

    **Material**: Basic guide on how to use github desktop or cheatsheet for the commandline

.. card::

    **Title**: DTU Brushup coding

    **Subtitle**: *Get ready for your studies at DTU!*

    **Goal**: Give a basic knowledge of computational thinking

    **Content**: Use board games such as Robo Rally to teach computational thinking. Move then to a computer and show the similarities.

    **Material**: Board games and pygame.
